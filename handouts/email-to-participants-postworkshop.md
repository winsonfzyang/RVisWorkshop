Dear workshop attendee,


Thank you for signing up and participating in the R Workshop: Introduction to data wrangling with Tidyverse.  

We have officially come to the end of the workshop. I hope that you had a fruitful 2-day workshop on data analysis with R.

If you would like to review the workshop materials again, I have uploaded the walkthrough solutions in the handouts folder of the repository (https://github.com/winsonfzyang/RWorkshop/tree/master/handouts). They have the suffix "completed.Rmd". The html files are the completed workbook for your reference in case you would like to view the completed workbook.

I have also uploaded the video link and completed workbook link on the Workshop web (https://winsonfzyang.github.io/RWorkshop/content/2-content.html). Please check them out if you want to refer to the notes at any time.

Please take some time to complete the post-workshop survey (https://ttupsych.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2au6MN31RW0U3l3). This will inform us on how to improve our future workshops and make your learning experience more fruitful!

Last but not least, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at any time!

Once again, thank you for attending this workshop!


Regards,
Winson Yang
