This is a two-day hands on workshop based on the book [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org). You will learn basic and advanced data visualization in R and learn some tips and tricks on creating plots, whether for a publication or a project. Along the way, you may encounter many packages and functions from the tidyverse including dplyr, tidyr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and forcats.

As I know everyone is busy with work, research, and classes, this workshop is not meant to teach you the basics of R, but to share some best practices in data visualization in R. Hence if you want to learn more foundational R programming or data wrangling, please check out [R Workshop](https://winsonfzyang.github.io/RWorkshop) to get started.
